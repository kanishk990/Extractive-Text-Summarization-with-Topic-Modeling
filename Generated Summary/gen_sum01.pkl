Mastering everyday conversation will let you hit the ground running. It’s more important to master basic phrases you’ll use frequently than it is to start off by learning the alphabet or the perfect sentence structure. Mastering basic vocabulary is probably one of the most important things you can do when learning a new language. There's no point in memorizing hundreds of words and phrases if you pronounce them so oddly that they can't be understood. The reason why most people can't remember most of the language they spent years learning in school is that school curricula tend to focus a huge amount of time on learning grammar and very little time on speech (or "comprehensible output"). This is pretty much backwards—if you want to learn a language quickly, you should learn how to converse first. The specifics of grammar will come later. Plus, it is better for you to be sounding the words out rather than looking at the romanization for the words. Speaking with a real, live person will help you to feel much more motivated about learning the language than staring at a book or computer screen.
