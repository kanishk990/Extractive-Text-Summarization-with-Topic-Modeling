==Steps==
===Paint===
#Remove the laces from your shoes and prep your work area. Set them aside so they aren’t in the “splash zone” while you paint.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXuvyjEZb5w&t=0m26s</ref> For extra protection, lay some newspaper sheets or paper towels over your work surface to catch any potential drips and spills.[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 1.jpg|center]]
#* Plain white AF1s typically come with white laces. Feel free to have some brighter, more colorful laces on deck if you’d like to switch things up.
#Wipe down the outside of your shoes with [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=acetone&crid=2Y9CU3GTEXZZG&sprefix=aceton%2Caps%2C95&ref=nb_sb_noss_2&tag=wikihow13305633-20 acetone]. Dip a clean [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cotton+balls&crid=2BNL66HJIE5GD&sprefix=cotton+balls%2Caps%2C87&ref=nb_sb_noss_1&tag=wikihow13305633-20 cotton ball] in acetone and rub it all over the outer surface of your shoes. Focus especially on the parts that you plan to paint over.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y386A_gua9k&t=4m15s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 2.jpg|center]]
#* All Air Force 1s have a clear layer of finish on the outside of the shoe leather. Any paint applied to this finish will eventually crack, which you definitely don’t want. Acetone helps remove this finish, giving you a better, more durable surface to work with. 
#*You can remove the dirt from the shoes first and use a small amount of mild laundry detergent to clean the shoes and shoelaces.<ref>https://www.nike.com/a/how-to-clean-shoes</ref><ref>[v161776_b01]. 15 April 2021.</ref> 
#*Carefully wash them with warm water to remove the dirty foam and dry them with a soft towel.<ref>https://www.nike.com/a/how-to-clean-shoes</ref><ref>[v161776_b01]. 15 April 2021.</ref> 
#*Leave them at room temperature to dry.<ref>https://www.nike.com/a/how-to-clean-shoes</ref><ref>[v161776_b01]. 15 April 2021.</ref> 
#Tape over any parts of your shoes that you don’t want to paint. Tear off several strips of [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=masking+tape&crid=33XA6815WD2DE&sprefix=masking+tap%2Caps%2C81&ref=nb_sb_noss_2&tag=wikihow13305633-20 masking tape] and stick them over the sections of your shoes that you’d like to protect.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXuvyjEZb5w&t=1m19s</ref> Go around the tape with an [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=x-acto+knife&sprefix=x-ac%2Caps%2C70&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_4&tag=wikihow13305633-20 X-ACTO knife] to create clean, smooth edges.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrJCSEo108o&t=58s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 3.jpg|center]]
#* You can also tape off any sections that you’d like to paint in a different color later on.
#* [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=vinyl+tape&crid=1VDU7Z3LNVXUM&sprefix=vinyl+tape%2Caps%2C70&ref=nb_sb_noss_1&tag=wikihow13305633-20 Vinyl tape] and [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=electrical+tape&sprefix=electr%2Caps%2C90&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_6&tag=wikihow13305633-20 electrical tape] can also work for this.
#* Be really careful and gentle when you’re working with the X-ACTO knife so you don’t scratch the shoe leather by mistake.
#[[Paint-Shoes#Applying-the-Paint|Apply acrylic leather paint]] to the shoes in a thin layer. Dip a small [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=thin+paintbrushes&crid=2VITF18Q12GQO&sprefix=thin+paintbrushes%2Caps%2C75&ref=nb_sb_noss_2&tag=wikihow13305633-20 paintbrush] into the [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=acrylic+leather+paint&crid=2G8FG98BKJ9R4&sprefix=acrylic+leather+pain%2Caps%2C93&ref=nb_sb_noss_2&tag=wikihow13305633-20 acrylic leather paint] color of your choice. Then, apply the paint directly to the shoe using thin, even strokes.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y386A_gua9k&t=7m15s</ref> It’s okay if the paint looks a little streaky at first; as you apply more layers, the color will look much more solid and consistent.[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 4.jpg|center]]
#* Since AF1s are made with leather-like material, it’s best to use acrylic leather paint for them.
#* Squeeze your paints into a plastic palette if you plan on using lots of different colors in your design.
#* Opt for smaller and thinner paintbrushes—these are a lot easier to handle since you’re working on such a small surface.
#Wait for the paint to dry completely. Each layer of acrylic leather paint needs around 15-30 minutes to dry completely.<ref>https://angelusdirect.com/apps/help-center#how-long-should-i-let-the-paint-dry-for</ref> Tap the shoe very lightly with your finger to make sure the paint is dry before you continue.[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 5.jpg|center]]
#* Grab a hair dryer if you’d like to speed things up. Turn it to a low heat setting and glide it back and forth above the surface of the shoe until the paint is dry to the touch.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y386A_gua9k&t=7m25s</ref>
#Apply 2-3 more layers of paint to your shoes. Continue painting in thin, even layers, giving each coat 15-30 minutes to air-dry. About 3-4 total coats of paint are enough to give you a bright and consistent paint job.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXuvyjEZb5w&t=2m26s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 6.jpg|center]]
#Add any extra designs on top of the base paint. Grab a thin, tapered paintbrush and dip it into the color of your choice. Then, draw your design over the colored background with slow, careful strokes.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p65dzX33nvQ&t=1m38s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 7.jpg|center]]
#* Polka dots, lines, checkers, and squiggly lines are all possible designs you could try.
#* Outline your color blocks with black paint to give them a sharp look.
#Let the shoes dry completely and remove any extra tape. Wait about 1 day for the acrylic leather paint to air-dry all the way. Once it’s completely dry to the touch, peel away any leftover tape to reveal your sleek, polished design.<ref>https://angelusdirect.com/apps/help-center#how-long-should-i-let-the-paint-dry-for</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 8.jpg|center]]
#Apply 1-2 layers of [https://www.amazon.com/Angelus-Acrylic-Leather-Finisher-600-4oz/dp/B00B5VTJJ6/ref=sr_1_3?crid=14KVECPKD8IUQ&keywords=acrylic+finish&qid=1659379948&sprefix=acrylic+finish%2Caps%2C83&sr=8-3&tag=wikihow13305633-20 acrylic finish] to seal your colorful paint job. Dip a small paintbrush into a bottle of an acrylic finish and spread it all over the parts of the shoe you just painted.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y386A_gua9k&t=12m17s</ref> Follow the instructions on the bottle to make sure that the finish sets and cures properly.[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 9.jpg|center]]
#* You can buy [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=acrylic+finish+spray&crid=JARVYHQK6OY9&sprefix=acrylic+finish+s%2Caps%2C63&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_16&tag=wikihow13305633-20 sprayable acrylic finish], but a regular bottle and paintbrush give you more control over the application process.
#* Acrylic finishes come in different sheens, with matte being the dullest and high gloss being the shiniest.<ref>https://angelusdirect.com/apps/help-center#what-is-the-difference-between-each-acrylic-finisher</ref>
#* Acrylic finish protects your shoes from getting scuffed when you wear them.<ref>https://angelusdirect.com/apps/help-center#hc-when-do-i-use-acrylic-finisher-vs-4-coat</ref>
 
===Paint Markers===
#Pull out any shoelaces and wipe away the shoe’s outer finish with [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=acetone&crid=2Y9CU3GTEXZZG&sprefix=aceton%2Caps%2C95&ref=nb_sb_noss_2&tag=wikihow13305633-20 acetone]. Soak a [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cotton+balls&crid=2BNL66HJIE5GD&sprefix=cotton+balls%2Caps%2C87&ref=nb_sb_noss_1&tag=wikihow13305633-20 cotton ball] in acetone and wipe down the outer surface of the shoe—this removes the shoe’s original finish and will help your paint markers adhere better. Set the removed shoelaces aside, in the meantime.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTfComgXmFs&t=1m35s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 10.jpg|center]]
#Sketch out your design in pencil directly on the shoes. Think about what kind of design or aesthetic you’d like to put on your shoes. Are you feeling something wild and fun, like leopard print, or something classic and iconic, like stripes and polka dots? Whatever your idea is, sketch it directly onto your shoes so you have a guide to follow.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj13nc5qFV4&t=0m42s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 11.jpg|center]]
#* Can’t decide on the best design for your shoes? No worries—Google Images has you covered. Search “Air Force 1 custom designs” or something similar to see how other people have customized their shoes.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTfComgXmFs&t=2m13s</ref>
#Prep your [https://www.amazon.com/Acrylic-Marker-Medium-Version-PC5M8SET/dp/B07Z86PHP8/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1CFQ2Z8TXEIC4&keywords=paint+markers&qid=1659380142&sprefix=paint+marker%2Caps%2C86&sr=8-6&tag=wikihow13305633-20 paint markers] by shaking and testing them on paper. Brand-new paint markers won’t give off a lot of color at first. To fix this, shake each marker vigorously and press the tip multiple times onto a sheet of paper. Eventually, the color will bleed through consistently and evenly.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTfComgXmFs&t=2m45s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 12.jpg|center]]
#Color in the design with your paint markers. Paint markers work exactly the same way as regular markers—simply draw and color in your shoe to your heart’s content! It may help to outline your sketch first and then shade everything in.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj13nc5qFV4&t=1m</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 13.jpg|center]]
#* Feel free to add a fun outline or design on top of your base color, too! Paint markers only take a few minutes to dry, so you don’t have to wait very long between layers.<ref>https://artradarjournal.com/2022/04/12/how-long-to-let-posca-paint-markers-dry-before-varnish/</ref>
#* Create a dynamic color scheme by coloring in different sections of your shoes with bold accents! You might color the eyestays a shade of light blue, the vamps (toe areas) a blue-green, and the Nike swooshes a navy blue.
#Apply a coat of [https://www.amazon.com/Angelus-Acrylic-Leather-Finisher-600-4oz/dp/B00B5VTJJ6/ref=sr_1_3?crid=14KVECPKD8IUQ&keywords=acrylic+finish&qid=1659379948&sprefix=acrylic+finish%2Caps%2C83&sr=8-3&tag=wikihow13305633-20 acrylic finish] over the design. Dip a small, thin [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=thin+paintbrushes&crid=2VITF18Q12GQO&sprefix=thin+paintbrushes%2Caps%2C75&ref=nb_sb_noss_2&tag=wikihow13305633-20 paintbrush] into a bottle of acrylic finish and apply it directly to the painted parts of your project.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y386A_gua9k&t=12m17s</ref> If you’re in a rush, feel free to spritz over your shoes with an [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=acrylic+finish+spray&crid=JARVYHQK6OY9&sprefix=acrylic+finish+s%2Caps%2C63&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_16&tag=wikihow13305633-20 acrylic finish spray], instead.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj13nc5qFV4&T=1m53s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 14.jpg|center]]
#* Follow the instructions on the can or bottle to see how much time the finish needs to cure.

===Rhinestones===
#Squeeze a small dot of [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=e6000+glue&sprefix=e6000%2Caps%2C80&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_5&tag=wikihow13305633-20 E6000 glue] onto the surface of the shoe. A small, pinhead-sized glob is a good size.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdC8aCmyl7c&t=3m12s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 15.jpg|center]]
#* For smaller, more precise dots of glue, use a [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=wooden+skewers&crid=2BBB2OCA45ZQS&sprefix=wooden+skewer%2Caps%2C102&ref=nb_sb_noss_1&tag=wikihow13305633-20 wooden skewer] to dab the glue directly to the back of a rhinestone.<ref>https://acultivatednest.com/diy-gem-shoes-how-to-bedazzle-sneakers/</ref>
#* To help the glue bond a bit better, use a cotton ball to dab acetone over the sections you plan on bedazzling beforehand.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrJCSEo108o&t=0m32s</ref>
#Place a [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=rhinestones&crid=2TI0L4UPW39QJ&sprefix=rhinestones%2Caps%2C90&ref=nb_sb_noss_1&tag=wikihow13305633-20 rhinestone] onto the glue with a pair of [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tweezer&crid=2XBS844Q6XN67&sprefix=tweezer%2Caps%2C83&ref=nb_sb_noss_1&tag=wikihow13305633-20 tweezers]. Center the gemstone as much as you can, using the tips of the tweezers to shift and adjust the rhinestone as needed. Then, press down on the gem so it stays in place.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdC8aCmyl7c&t=3m26s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 16.jpg|center]]
#* It’s no big deal if your glue smears a bit—just get rid of any errant spots with acetone.
#* The Nike swoosh, vamp (toe area), backtab, and eyestay are all great parts of the shoe to bedazzle.
#Continue squeezing glue and arranging the gemstones in place. Squeeze another small dot of glue onto your shoe, next to the previous rhinestone. Then, grab another stone and adjust it until it’s in the correct spot.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdC8aCmyl7c&t=4m1s</ref> Repeat this process until you’re happy with the number of rhinestones.[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 17.jpg|center]]
#* Try placing multicolor rhinestones down in a fun, colorful pattern.
#* If you’re bedazzling a small section of your shoes (like the Nike swoosh), outline the shape with gemstones before filling it in.
#Let the glue cure for at least 1 day before trying on your new kicks. E6000 glue needs at least 1 day to cure all the way, so leave your shoes alone in the meantime. To be extra safe, wait at least 2-3 days before wearing your bedazzled shoes.<ref>https://eclecticproducts.com/downloads/tds-e6000-craft-english.pdf</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 18.jpg|center]]

===Fabric===
#Unlace your shoes and remove the outer finish with [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=acetone&crid=2Y9CU3GTEXZZG&sprefix=aceton%2Caps%2C95&ref=nb_sb_noss_2&tag=wikihow13305633-20 acetone]. Pour a little bit of acetone onto a [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cotton+balls&crid=2BNL66HJIE5GD&sprefix=cotton+balls%2Caps%2C87&ref=nb_sb_noss_1&tag=wikihow13305633-20 cotton ball] and rub down the outside of the shoe—specifically, the sections you plan on customizing. The acetone strips the factory finish from the AF1s, which makes it easier for the glue to bond.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrJCSEo108o&t=0m32s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 19.jpg|center]]
#Apply strips of [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=masking+tape&crid=33XA6815WD2DE&sprefix=masking+tap%2Caps%2C81&ref=nb_sb_noss_2&tag=wikihow13305633-20 masking tape] to the areas you’d like to accent. Grab a wide strip of masking tape and stick it directly onto the shoe. You may need to overlap multiple strips of tape, depending on the size of the section you’re customizing.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrJCSEo108o&t=0m52s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 20.jpg|center]]
#* The vamp (toe swoop) and Nike swoosh are both great spots to accent with fabric.
#Trim the tape to an exact shape with an [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=x-acto+knife&sprefix=x-ac%2Caps%2C70&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_4&tag=wikihow13305633-20 X-ACTO knife]. Carefully guide the X-ACTO knife along the edge of the tape, removing the excess as you go. Try to be as exact as possible so the tape perfectly masks the section of shoe that you’re planning to accent.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrJCSEo108o&t=0m58s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 21.jpg|center]]
#Peel away the shaped tape and place it on a piece of [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fabric&crid=1SN3JR8PO2VWK&sprefix=fabric%2Caps%2C85&ref=nb_sb_noss_1&tag=wikihow13305633-20 fabric]. Place the tape sticky-side-down on a piece of fabric so you can cut around it.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3wZHpO9Jls&t=2m18s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 22.jpg|center]]
#* Any type of fabric will work for this! You might keep things simple and bright with a solid-colored piece of fabric, or add a bit of flair with a plaid- or tropical-patterned material.
#Cut around the tape to make a fabric duplicate of the shape. Grab a pair of [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fabric+scissors&crid=37NK54RAN4PEI&sprefix=fabric+scissor%2Caps%2C87&ref=nb_sb_noss_1&tag=wikihow13305633-20 fabric scissors] and snip around the tape in a small circle or square. Then, cut around the curves and edges of the tape and set the taped piece of fabric aside.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3wZHpO9Jls&t=2m25s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 23.jpg|center]]
#Spread a layer of [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=e6000+glue&sprefix=e6000%2Caps%2C80&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_5&tag=wikihow13305633-20 E6000 glue] over the part you’d like to accent. Squeeze the glue directly onto the section of the shoe you’re planning to mask. Move the glue around with the tip of the glue bottle so it spreads in an even layer.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3wZHpO9Jls&t=2m51s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 24.jpg|center]]
#* You can also paint the glue onto the shoe using a [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=thin+paintbrushes&crid=2VITF18Q12GQO&sprefix=thin+paintbrushes%2Caps%2C75&ref=nb_sb_noss_2&tag=wikihow13305633-20 small paintbrush].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lDMBRytV60&t=1m34s</ref> Just be sure to clean the brush thoroughly so the bristles don’t harden!
#Press the cut fabric in place on top of the glue and peel away the tape. Center the fabric mask on top of the glue, making sure that it’s lined up perfectly. Then, carefully peel away the masking tape from the fabric.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrJCSEo108o&t=3m18s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 25.jpg|center]]
#* It may help to stick the fabric down in sections, rather than pressing it down all at once.
#Repeat the taping process with other sections you’d like to customize. Mask over these sections with tape, trim around the edges with an [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=x-acto+knife&sprefix=x-ac%2Caps%2C70&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_4&tag=wikihow13305633-20 X-ACTO knife], and stick the tape outline to the fabric. All that’s left is cutting out the fabric, gluing it down, and letting it dry.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrJCSEo108o&t=4m57s</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 26.jpg|center]]
#Wait at least 1 day for the glue to cure. E6000 is a really strong glue, but it needs at least 1 day to cure completely. Give your newly customized AF1s some time to dry before taking them out for a test run.<ref>https://eclecticproducts.com/downloads/tds-e6000-craft-english.pdf</ref>[[Image:Customize Air Force 1 Step 27.jpg|center]]
#* To be on the safe side, give your shoes 2-3 days to cure completely.

==Tips==
