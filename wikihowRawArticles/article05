*Dry your bouquet by pressing it, hanging it upside down, or submerging it in silica gel.
*Coat your bouquet’s flowers in wax or resin for a lasting and protective shine.
*Ask a florist or painter to help you preserve your bouquet if you’re not crafty.

==Steps==
===Press the flowers and put them in a frame.===
#Flatten your bouquet to display it on a wall for lasting memories. Arrange the flowers individually on sheets of paper towel. Lay another sheet of paper towel over the flowers and set a piece of cardboard on top. Place thick books or heavy items on the cardboard to [[Press-Flowers|press the flowers]].<ref>https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/kids/activities/preservewildflowers.shtml</ref> Wait 2 weeks, then remove the cardboard and paper towels. Place the dried flowers on a piece of cardstock the size of your desired frame, and make a 2D replica of your bouquet.<ref>https://youtu.be/0h5n2_vfaq4?t=42</ref>[[Image:Preserve Wedding Bouquet Step 1 Version 3.jpg|center]]
#*Take a picture of your bouquet before you press your flowers, so you’ll know how to arrange them in the frame.
#*Flowers that don’t have bulbous centers are the easiest to press, such as daisies, primroses, violas, and pansies.<ref>[v161368_b01]. 15 April 2020.</ref>
#*If your bouquet has flowers with multiple folded petals like roses, pull the petals off the flower to press individually. This will keep the entire flower from mashing in on itself during the pressing process.<ref>[v161368_b01]. 15 April 2020.</ref>

===Hang the flowers upside down to air-dry.===
#Dry out your bouquet for an antique and natural look. Hang your bouquet upside down by tying a string around the flower stems and securing them to a wall hook or open wall beam. The flowers will dry out over time, the air sucking out the moisture slowly and naturally. Keep your bouquet hanging or place it in a [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cloche+bell+vase&crid=1I0JYRHZH8W4W&sprefix=cloche+bell+vase%2Caps%2C57&ref=nb_sb_noss_2&tag=wikihow13311158-20 cloche bell vase] once it’s fully dry (after about 2 weeks).<ref>[v161368_b01]. 15 April 2020.</ref>[[Image:Preserve Wedding Bouquet Step 2 Version 3.jpg|center]]
#*Hanging the flowers upside down helps them keep their shape.
#*Try hanging your flowers from a clothing rack or clothes hanger if there’s no place to secure them to the ceiling or wall.

===Cover the flowers with silica gel.===
#Silica gel preserves flowers by absorbing moisture. Cut the flowers from the stems and fluff out the petals.<ref>https://youtu.be/z6_q8xiWQMg?t=375</ref> Purchase [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=silica+gel+flower+drying&sprefix=silica+%2Caps%2C89&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_2_7&tag=wikihow13311158-20 silica gel for flower drying] online or at a craft store. Following the instructions on your silica gel, pour the gel into an air-tight container and submerge the flowers. Let the flowers dry out for up to a week (depending on what your brand of silica gel states).<ref>https://youtu.be/1g3HqMskDwc?t=4</ref>[[Image:Preserve Wedding Bouquet Step 3 Version 3.jpg|center]]
#*The vibrancy of your flowers will fade slightly in the drying process, but they’ll maintain their hue and color for about 10 years.<ref>[v161368_b01]. 15 April 2020.</ref>
#*Arrange your dried bouquet in a [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=shadow+box&crid=19MYMG13MTB13&sprefix=shadow+box%2Caps%2C118&ref=nb_sb_noss_1&tag=wikihow13311158-20 shadow box] to show off your DIY and special day. Hot glue the dried flowers to a piece of cardstock or cardboard the size of your shadow box and slip it inside. 

===Dip the flowers in melted wax.=== 
#Paraffin wax adds a glistening shine to preserved fresh flowers. Melt a {{convert|1|lb|g|abbr=on}} of [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=paraffin+wax&i=arts-crafts&crid=3S2752353Z224&sprefix=paraffin+wax%2Carts-crafts%2C102&ref=nb_sb_noss_1&tag=wikihow13311158-20 paraffin wax] in a double boiler. Cut the stems of your flowers to about {{convert|2 to 3|in|cm}}. Hold the flower by the stem and dip the petals into {{convert|150|F|C}} wax, completely submerging the head of the flower. Lift it out immediately, let the excess wax drip off, and place long-ways on a parchment-lined tray. Once all the petals are covered in wax, dip the stems in.<ref>https://www.marthastewart.com/268799/waxed-flowers</ref>[[Image:Preserve Wedding Bouquet Step 4 Version 3.jpg|center]]
#*Avoid [[Preserve-Cut-Flowers-With-Wax|waxing flowers]] that have delicate or thin petals as the heat could cause them to wither.
#*Store your waxed flowers in an airtight display case for years to come, or keep them in a vase for about a week.
#*Keep your bouquet in water or have someone care for it during your honeymoon. This way, the flowers will still be fresh when you return from your excursion (if your honeymoon is over a few days long, consider preserving your bouquet right away).

===Set the flowers with resin.===
#Use epoxy resin to transform your bouquet into a paperweight or 3D model. Mix together equal parts A and B of [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=casting+resin&i=arts-crafts&sprefix=casting+resin%2Carts-crafts%2C108&ref=nb_sb_ss_c_3_13_ts-doa-p&tag=wikihow13311158-20 clear epoxy resin]. Pour the mixture into a [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=silicone+mold+for+resin&i=arts-crafts&crid=WTYHXUHI69FH&sprefix=silicone+mold+%2Carts-crafts%2C74&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_2_14&tag=wikihow13311158-20 silicone mold] (circle, heart, square, etc.). Carefully place your dried flowers in the epoxy until they’re completely covered. Let the epoxy dry for a day, and voila—you have your very own preserved model of your wedding bouquet!<ref>https://youtu.be/0-2xDD7RJ_0?t=127</ref>[[Image:Preserve Wedding Bouquet Step 5 Version 3.jpg|center]]
#*Dry your bouquet’s flowers before [[Preserve-Roses-in-Resin|setting them in the epoxy]] by hanging them upside down for 2 weeks or placing them in silica gel for about a week.
#*Let the epoxy mixture sit for about 10 minutes, so unwanted bubbles rise to the surface and pop.
#*Try working in multiple layers (letting one layer dry before adding more epoxy on top) to recreate your full bouquet.
#*Wear proper PPE material ([https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ppe+gloves&sprefix=ppe+gl%2Caps%2C69&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_2_6&tag=wikihow13311158-20 gloves] and [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mask+for+epoxy+resin+fumes&crid=191HHPXHSN2BR&sprefix=mask+for+epo%2Caps%2C74&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_12&tag=wikihow13311158-20 mask]) and work in a well-ventilated space when working with resin as the chemicals can be toxic.

===Spray the flowers with hairspray.===
#Use hairspray to preserve the petals of your bouquet. Hang your bouquet flowers upside down to dry for at least 2 weeks. Then, [[Preserve-Flowers-with-Hairspray|spray the flowers with hairspray]], covering the petals, stems, and leaves. Let the flowers dry for about 10 minutes and repeat. Arrange the dried flowers in a large bell covering, or cut off the stems and lay the flowers inside a small glass jar.[[Image:Preserve Wedding Bouquet Step 6 Version 3.jpg|center]]
#*If the flowers are not placed in an air-tight container, they’ll need to be touched up with hairspray every 2 to 3 weeks to keep them preserved.

===Send the flowers to be freeze-dried.===
#[[Freeze-Dry-Flowers|Freeze-drying flowers]] takes time but keeps your bouquet from aging. This is a process you can do yourself if you have a freeze-dryer, or you can hire a specialist to freeze-dry your bouquet for you.<ref>https://ipm.missouri.edu/MEG/2008/7/Preserving-Flowers/</ref> Simply keep your bouquet in a vase with water until you're ready to preserve them (the sooner you do this after your wedding, the more vibrant your preserved flowers will be). Then, when the time comes, hand them over to the flower preservationist and wait 2 to 3 weeks to pick them up.[[Image:Preserve Wedding Bouquet Step 7 Version 3.jpg|center]]
#*Display your freeze-dried bouquet in a shadow box to protect the delicate, dried petals.

===Contact a florist to preserve your flowers.===
#If you’re not crafty, ask a florist to preserve your bouquet for you. Sometimes, it’s best to leave it to the professionals, especially if you’re worried about ruining your wedding bouquet! Schedule an appointment with a florist before your wedding to devise a preservation plan. They’ll be able to talk you through your options and make a plan for when the flowers should be preserved.[[Image:Preserve Wedding Bouquet Step 8 Version 3.jpg|center]]
#*Ask the florist arranging your bouquet if they preserve flowers. If they don’t, maybe they have a friend or colleague who does.
#*Consider reaching out to a small business or [https://www.etsy.com Etsy] shop that preserves flowers, especially if you want something niche done to your bouquet.

===Hire a painter to paint a picture of your flowers.===
#An artistic rendition of your bouquet can help your flowers live forever. Schedule a session with a painter for after your wedding when your bouquet is still fresh and vibrant. Ask them to paint the flowers as is or add a mystical flair to it. This is a simplistic and minimalistic way to keep your gorgeous bouquet alive for decades to come.[[Image:Preserve Wedding Bouquet Step 9 Version 3.jpg|center]]
#*If you’re hiring a painter to paint your wedding ceremony or reception, ask them to paint your bouquet too. 
#*Consider painting your bouquet yourself if you enjoy painting or want to try your knack at watercolor, acrylic, or oil paints.

==Tips==
* Flowers can be dried in the microwave; however, this isn’t recommended for wedding bouquets because the petals are often too thick and won’t dry evenly.<ref>https://ipm.missouri.edu/MEG/2008/7/Preserving-Flowers/</ref>
