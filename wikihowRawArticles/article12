===Best Odds===
#Blackjack{endbold} The odds of winning any Blackjack game is around 42%. This simple card game isn’t hard to master, and you’re only playing against the dealer, not multiple people. The rules to [[Play Blackjack|play blackjack]] are simple: the dealer and the players compete to see who can get closest to 21 without going over. If you get closer to 21 than the dealer does, you win.<ref>https://www.scu.edu/illuminate/thought-leaders/phil-kesten/outsmarting-the-casino-at-blackjack.html</ref>[[Image:Best Odds in Casino Step 1.jpg|center]]
#*Blackjack is mostly about luck, and in general, the house edge (or the advantage that the house has over you over time), is only about 2%. 
#Craps{endbold} You have an almost 50% chance that you’ll win Craps. To [[Play Craps|play Craps]], one person is the shooter (who rolls the dice), and the other players place bets on the results of the roll. The shooter can win if they roll a 7 or 11, but if not, the number they roll is now the “point.” The shooter has to match that point before rolling a 7 to win. If you aren’t the shooter, you can place a bet on whether or not the shooter will win.<ref>https://www.onlinegambling.com/casino/craps/how-to-play/</ref>[[Image:Best Odds in Casino Step 2.jpg|center]]
#*In general, making a “pass line” bet on whether or not the shooter will win gives you 50/50 odds. 
#*There are a couple of other bets you can place as well, including whether or not the shooter will hit a different number before the 7. These other bets lower your chances of winning, but can net you more earnings in the end. 
#Baccarat{endbold} The odds of winning a Baccarat game is around 44%. Another table game, [[Win Baccarat|playing Baccarat]] is becoming more and more popular in Las Vegas. To play, simply place your bet on either the player or the banker. Both sides will draw cards, and whoever is closer to 9 wins.<ref>https://www.gambling.com/us/online-casinos/strategy/10-casino-games-with-the-lowest-house-edge-1550900</ref>[[Image:Best Odds in Casino Step 3.jpg|center]]
#*Some Baccarat tables have minimum bets of $25 or $50. 
#Roulette{endbold} Depending on how you bet, you have a 50% chance of winning Roulette. Spin the wheel to [[Play Roulette|play Roulette]] and win big. A Roulette table is actually a big wheel with numbers 00 - 36. The Roulette dealer will spin the wheel, and the ball will fall onto 1 of those numbers. You can place your bet on whether the ball will fall on a black or red piece, or you can place a bet on a specific number.<ref>https://www.gambling.com/us/online-casinos/strategy/10-casino-games-with-the-lowest-house-edge-1550900</ref>[[Image:Best Odds in Casino Step 4.jpg|center]]
#*Placing a bet on whether the number will be black or red gives you odds of almost 50/50. 

===Worst Odds===
#Slot machines {endbold} There’s a reason why slot machines grab your attention so quickly! Slot machines make the casino more money than any other game, which means your odds of winning are very, very low. If you want to keep your money or even make some, stay away from the slot machines whenever you gamble.<ref>https://www.gambling.com/us/online-casinos/strategy/10-casino-games-with-the-lowest-house-edge-1550900</ref>[[Image:Best Odds in Casino Step 5.jpg|center]]
#The Wheel of Fortune{endbold} Also called The Big Six Wheel, The Big Six, or the Money Wheel, this game of chance lets you bet on specific icons or symbols. If the wheel lands on your bet, you win! However, most players do not see big winnings, and the house edge for this game is a whopping 16%.<ref>https://www.vegashowto.com/worst-casino-games-las-vegas</ref>[[Image:Best Odds in Casino Step 6.jpg|center]]
#Keno{endbold} Keno is a dice game that’s kind of like the lottery: you pick your numbers, then the dealer randomly selects 20 dice out of 80 possible numbers. If you guess the numbers correctly, you win.<ref>https://www.vegashowto.com/worst-casino-games-las-vegas</ref>[[Image:Best Odds in Casino Step 7.jpg|center]]
#*Keno has a house edge of 25% to 30%, meaning that for every dollar you bet, you lose about 25 to 30 cents. 

== Tips ==
*In general, you have a higher chance of winning any table game than you do a slot machine.
*Poker games vary wildly in how likely you are to win. There’s no way to accurately gauge whether or not you’ll win a poker game until you’re playing it.
